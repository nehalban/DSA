Binary Trees:
Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children - never 1

Complete or Perfect Binary Tree: All levels completely filled
Almost Complete Binary Tree: Last level may not be completely filled - all nodes towards left
{Tree is being constructed level-wise from left to right}

Balanced Binary tree: heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

Degenerate Tree: nodes are arranged in a single path leaning to the right or left; resembles singly linked list
